## Data
- We wanted to solve it using a computer vision of how to quickly classify COVID-19 patients.
- We got data from kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehradaria/covid19-lung-ct-scans
- My role in the project is apply a EfficientNet to the data.
- Based on what I have read about Computer Vision, I applied it to actual data and implemented it as a code!
- In the EfficientNet Model, We obtained 82% test accuracy. (It's pretty good!)


## What I felt.
- I used to use my old laptop, Core i3, and I got a memory error.
- I switched to Colab. It was my first time experiencing Colab, and GPU was a whole new world. Because at that time, It was my first time to use Colab.
- First of all, the terms were different for each site referred to. In the case of MobileNet and EfficientNet that I read, the part that says the "filter" is called "window" on some sites and "kernel" on some sites. It was very confusing to recognize that the term was the same concept.
